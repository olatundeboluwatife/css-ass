        Before starting a relationship, how about asking yourself a few questions?
        I realize that due to lack of experience, many people start relationships overnight, without much thought.
        Guess the result of this? Dating that ends in a few weeks or months, as well as major disappointments and
        emotional wounds.
        Given this, I have prepared 5 questions for you to ask yourself before starting a relationship.
        They will help you a lot to know if it's really time to start a relationship. Shall we go to them?
        1) “Do I believe that my vocation is marriage?”
        I've seen people give the following advice to those who are undecided about their vocation: Joãozinho, date
        Ritinha to see if your vocation is really marriage, so you take the test.

        This advice would be excellent if Joãozinho and Ritinha were robots. People of flesh and blood have feelings and
        this "testing" can bring great emotional wounds to both.
        In dating there is a great emotional involvement, because there is affection, exchange of experiences and
        conversations and sharing; one is very attached to the other.
        When that relationship is broken for whatever reason, both suffer and feel that emptiness in their chests, just
        like when someone dies.
        In addition, we must remember that dating is already a preparation for marriage. It is the period when the
        couple meets to see if the marriage would work out.
        Therefore, in the same way that it makes no sense to go to college without knowing if you want to have a higher
        education, it makes no sense to date without believing you will get married.
        Therefore, only start a relationship if you think you are destined for marriage, if you feel inclined to do so.
        2) “Am I mature enough?”
        When young people ask me at what age they can start dating, I always say it's at the age when there's a certain
        maturity.

        It is usually reached after the age of eighteen, but this varies from person to person. There are people who are
        twenty-five years old and have a maturity of fifteen.
        But what would this “certain maturity” be?
        When it comes to relationships, maturity primarily means being emotionally and affectively developed.
        Being emotionally developed is about controlling your emotions (passion, fear, anger, sadness, jealousy, envy,
        excitement) and not being controlled by them.
        For example, girls who have bouts of jealousy and insecurity are certainly emotionally immature, just as
        aggressive and violent boys are.
        In turn, being affectively developed means having a stable and altruistic affectivity, that is, the person loves
        in a lasting and generous way, without selfishness.
        The biggest examples of affective immature are those who each month are with a different boyfriend, that is, if
        they date, as they usually prefer to “stay”.
        3) “Is my heart well resolved?”
        I suggest not starting a new relationship if you haven't gotten over the last one yet.
        When someone mends one relationship with another, two things mainly happen:
        The chance to reflect and learn from the old relationship is lost, something essential for personal growth.
        You run the risk of starting a relationship due to lack. Such a relationship won't last long, which will cause
        even more emotional wounds.
        Therefore, analyze if your heart is well resolved, because then you will enter the relationship with a free
        heart and mind to be filled with this new person.
        4) “Do I like him/her?”
        I know it's an obvious question, but so many people get stuck on it.
        Amazingly, a lot of people don't know whether or not they like someone else.
        Worse than that is just starting a relationship without liking the person...
        And when I say like, I'm not even talking about passion, because it's not mandatory. You don't have to be in
        love to start dating. I speak of attraction, of charm, of affection, of affection.
        It is evident that these things do not happen overnight, it is necessary to live together.
        So, if you still don't like someone, live with them, have a good friendship, because a good feeling can arise.
        However, if you lived together and still nothing came up, life goes on!
        It's no use dating because the other person is beautiful, rich, nice people or because everyone is pressuring
        you to date them. Choose someone you like.
        5) “Do we have similar life goals?”
        Finally, before starting a relationship, ask yourself if you have similar life goals.
        For example, if one person in the couple is a Christian and the other has no religion, problems are likely to
        arise between them.
        If one person wants to live chastity and the other does not, it is certain that they will not understand each
        other.
        If one person is open to life and the other is not, conflicts will obviously arise in a future marriage.
        I could give dozens of examples showing that different life goals kill any relationship.
        I repeat, courtship is a preparation for marriage, a sacrament that will make man and woman “one flesh” (Gen
        2:24).
        In one flesh there can be no great disagreements. Have you ever thought if the brain tells the foot to walk, but
        the foot says it prefers to stay still? It would be bizarre.
        So see if you are looking for similar things Before starting a relationship, how about asking yourself a few questions?
